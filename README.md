# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
The project is aimed at predicting the costs of used cars given the data collected from various sources and distributed across various locations in India. I have applied Machine Learning regression algorithms to achieve very high accuracy using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, label encoding and a few more processes as well.
